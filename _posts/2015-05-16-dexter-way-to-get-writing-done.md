Dexter Morgan, blood spater analyst, serial killer, Miami Homicide employee, the Bay Harbour butcher, loving father, sociopath, and boyfriend. 

You may wonder how all these words can be in the same sentence. Well, that's Dexter. He is America's favorite serial killer. He is charming; , he is brilliant; he can tell you who the killer is by just looking at the crime scene. He is sometimes naive; poor at interpreting emotions of normal people. But he is dangourous. Killing ferocious killers twice his size. You don't want to end up on his table (Where he chops people up). 

Those who watched the Dexter series are familier with Dexter and his 'dark passenger.' For others, a brief backstory. 

Dexter began to menifest violent psychopathic tendencies when he was a child. His foster father Harry, a cop, noticed this. He told Dexter that his violent urges were because of a childhood trauma, and said 'It' got inside Dexter very early. 

Dexter began calling it his “Dark Passenger.”
