Dexter Morgan, serial killer, lab geek, The bay harbour butcher, Miami metro homicide employee, loving father, socio-path, and lover. 

You may wonder how all these words can be in the same sentence. Well, That's Dexter. He is America's favorite serial killer. He is charming, brilliant and sometimes naive. But he's also dangerous and ferocious. You don't want to end up on his table. (Kill table)

If you have watched the show, you're familiar with Dexter and his dark passenger.
